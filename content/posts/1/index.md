# Who Am I? What Do I Want?

In the first chapter of *F?@k Knows*, the author presents two powerful questions that only *you* can truly answer: "Who am I?" and "What do I want?" These questions are simple yet profound, pushing us to reflect on our identity and desires. Let’s explore why these questions matter and how reflecting on them can shape our lives.

## Who Am I?

The question "Who am I?" invites us to examine our identity. It goes beyond labels or titles – it asks us to understand who we are at our core. Are we defined by our roles in society, our relationships, or something deeper? Answering this question requires deep self-awareness and introspection. It can be a journey of uncovering our strengths, weaknesses, values, and passions.

### Why It's Important
Understanding who we are allows us to make decisions that align with our true selves. When we know who we are, we are less likely to be swayed by outside opinions or distractions. We gain the power to live authentically.

## What Do I Want?

The second question, "What do I want?" forces us to confront our desires and ambitions. What do you truly want out of life – for yourself, for your career, for your relationships? It’s easy to get caught up in what others expect from us or what seems possible, but this question invites us to get clear on what we truly seek.

### Why It's Important
Knowing what we want is essential for setting goals and taking action. Without clarity on what we desire, it’s easy to wander through life without purpose. When we are clear on our desires, we can create a roadmap to get there.

## Reflecting on These Questions

Answering "Who am I?" and "What do I want?" is not a one-time task – it's an ongoing process. Our answers may change over time, but these questions help us stay aligned with our true self and our goals. Taking the time to reflect on these questions can lead to greater self-awareness, clarity, and purpose in life.

Imagine two people answering these questions. One might say:  

**Who am I?**  
“I am a creative thinker who loves solving problems. I value independence and learning new things.”  

**What do I want?**  
“I want to build something meaningful, maybe a business that aligns with my passion for technology.”  

Another person might say:  

**Who am I?**  
“I’m someone who thrives on human connection and making a difference in people’s lives.”  

**What do I want?**  
“I want to travel, meet new people, and work in a field that allows me to help others.”  

There are no right or wrong answers—just insights that help guide our choices.

Take a moment to reflect on these two questions: Who are you, and what do you want? The answers might surprise you and guide you in ways you never expected.
